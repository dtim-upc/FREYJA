happy derren brown explores changing concepts of happiness - from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the stoics and epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. he shows how many of self-help’s suggested routes to happiness and success – such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals – can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety. happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. by taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that ‘everything’s fine’ even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily._______praise for happy:_"crammed with wisdom

administration and computer science. while business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.matthias weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. to this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. after starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. in addition, he shows how standards like wfmc, soap, wsdl, and bpel fit into the picture.this textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management. this 2nd
