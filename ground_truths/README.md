This folder contains modified versions of ground truths from popular benchmarks. These modifications are:
- All of these versions contain only four columns with the same names: _target_ds_, _target_attr_, _candidate_ds_, _candidate_attr_
- For large ground truths (i.e. D3L and TUS Big) we have gathered a sample of the original data.

The data included in this folder presents the following characteristics:
- FREYJA
	- [Link](https://mydisk.cs.upc.edu/s/QHJbKcyeacxq35f)
	- 50 query columns, with k >= 10
	- Test settings: starting from k = 1 and until k = 10, with k increasing by 1 (i.e. test for k in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]), for a total of 10 results.
- D3L:
